# Find your NYC home app

### This is not actually the project I've done by myself!!!

I've been adding code following the videos in course on Google Maps APIs made by [Google](google.com) itself and [Udacity](udacity.com).
You can find almost the same code in this course's repo which is [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud864).

There are some minor differences I've made:
- Separated everything in different files and folders
- My stylesheet is different
- This exact app shows the area of a polygon when you draw it
- I am pretty sure some mistypings are included :)

Also notice that in this app the array of locations (all are on Manhattan, NYC) is used as an example. As it is a real estate app, you'd probably like to parse those locations from your database or whereever else.
